## Introduction

The Emotion Classification with CNN project aims to build a robust image classification model that can accurately identify emotions in images. This project is ideal for those interested in computer vision and deep learning applications in emotion recognition.

## Dataset Loading

To train our model, we use a dataset containing images labeled with various emotions, such as happy and sad. The dataset is preprocessed and loaded to ensure it is suitable for training the CNN model.(I use google images for that)

## Model Building

The core of this project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a deep learning framework. The CNN architecture is designed to extract features from the images and classify them into different emotion categories.

## Training Loop

In the training loop, the model learns to recognize patterns associated with different emotions in the images. This involves multiple iterations where the model's performance is monitored through training and validation losses to ensure it is learning effectively.

## Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capability. Various metrics are used to measure the performance of the model and ensure it meets the desired criteria.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download and prepare the dataset.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start training the model with the provided scripts. After training, use the model to classify emotions in new images and explore its capabilities.
